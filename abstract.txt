In the recent times, we have been seeing a massive raise in brain stroke cases all over the world. Stroke is one of the leading causes of the death worldwide these days. About 1/5th of patients with an acute stroke dies within a month of event and at least 1/2 of those who survive are left with physical disability. So, we have developed a model to predict whether a person is affected with brain stroke or not. so, on top of this we have also created a Front End framework with Tkinter GUI where we can input the image and the model will try to predict the output and display it on the window.
